### Hello üêí

Welcome to my github. Here you'll find some frontend projects, some backend projects, and of course, some full stack projects. Software development is fun (^L^)

I'm currently working on acquiring a production key from Riot Games so that my largest project, JungleDiff, can be publicly (and legally) hosted. I'm also working on creating a website that allows users to practice basic music theory concepts with a progression system.
